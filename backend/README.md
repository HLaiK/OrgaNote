# OrgaNote
OrgaNote is a minimalist productivity tool that auto-formats messy to-do lists into clean, structured, and visually organized tasks. Unlike Notion or Todoist, it prioritizes simplicity—just write, click, and get clarity. Designed to reduce cognitive load, OrgaNote blends the ease of jotting things down with the power of automation.
